=ML-15: Random Number Generator=

==Seed==
To initialize the random number generator, enter a number between 0 and 199017 and press $$E$$.

==Range [0, 1]==
$$SBR 2nd DMS$$

==Uniform distribution in [A, B]==
* A $$A$$
* B $$B$$
* $$C$$

==Normal Distribution==
* Desired mean $$A$$
* Desired standard deviation $$B$$
* $$2nd C'$$

==Statistics==
* $$2nd E'$$
* Generate random numbers as above
* $$2nd avg$$: gives the mean
* $$inv 2nd avg$$ gives the standard deviation
