=Indirect Modifier=
:$$2nd Ind$$ '''dd'''
:Code: ''40'', In Help Files: ''Ind''
This modifier can be used after any instruction that takes as parameter an integer, such as $$SBR$$ '''ddd'''. The modifier $$2nd Ind$$ is followed by 2 digits '''dd'''. The implied parameter of the modified instruction is the value of register '''dd''', that is the parameter is given indirectly, through a register.
For example if register 00 has value 123, $$GTO 2nd ind 00$$ is equivalent to $$GTO 123$$.
