This program allows to test the ''3n + 1 conjecture'', a problem that has baffled mathematicians since it was proposed by ''Lothar Collatz'' in 1937.

Consider an integer '''n'''. If it's even, divide it by 2: '''n/2'''. If it's odd, multiply by 3 and add 1: '''3n + 1'''.

For example, if we start with 17, we get the following sequence:
:17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
Once it reaches 1, the sequence repeats forever:
:1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, ...
The question is: if we start with an arbitrary integer will we always reach 1? Nobody knows.

: Enter '''n''' and press $$A$$
The display will show the corresponding sequence. This sequence will be also printed.
To have a sense of why this conjecture is not obvious, start with 27...
